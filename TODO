for clarity, add an "attraction field" to gather corpses to their respective location, if they're knocked too far away from it.
    - could be an upgrade\spell, have corpses knocked too far fade out and be deleted otherwise

Necro lunge is from corpse spawning on top of it, do a check to make sure corpses don't spawn on top of other bodies
