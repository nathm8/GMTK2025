wip tutorial text:
    You are a necromancer! you must tour the countryside, building up your legion of undead Minions. You must begin and end each day at your Tower. Click the tower, then click a Location to add it to your route. Initially you can only venture one Location away from your Tower, as you gather more Minions you may travel further. Locations that will allow you to return to your Tower are marked with Green paths

have glow for mousing over locations, instead of target reticle
Combat
    - assign targets to each unit randomly, fling as per corpse pickup
have different glow for locations in range of current planned stop
show road ghosts when hovering
show error when unable to go further
Necro lunge is from corpse spawning on top of it, do a check to make sure corpses don't spawn on top of other bodies
    just increased corpse density
Before forcing the corpse-unit joint, lerp the corpse towards the unit for a second
    just increased corpse density
for clarity, add an "attraction field" to gather corpses to their respective location, if they're knocked too far away from it.
    - could be an upgrade\spell, have corpses knocked too far fade out and be deleted otherwise
    
fade in\out for defeat
